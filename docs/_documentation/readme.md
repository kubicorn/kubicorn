## Rules

### Know what you are writing

You either are writing cloud specific docs or you aren't.

If you are writing documentation for a cloud, please treat it as such.

Cloud docs have a `doctype: [cloud]` property, and talk about specific clouds. The property can be `aws`, `azure`, `do`, or `google`.

If you are writing docs for global concepts, never mention a cloud. In this case you should use `doctype: general`.

All documentation files should include the following header:

```
---
layout: documentation
title: [The title of your document]
date: YYYY-MM-DD
doctype: [general/aws/azure/do/google]
---
```

Do not include top level headers on the document, e.g. `# Title`. The title is pulled from `title: ??` on the header above. On the file you can start with level two, e.g. `## Second level header` or go straight to normal text.

### Keep tables formatted

If you are making a table in markdown: YES, we expect you to format them nicely. Keep our shit clean please.

### Complete sentences

A complete sentence expresses a complete thought.

Always write complete sentences.

Always use proper grammar.

Each sentence goes on a new line.

### Write inclusively

Always use "we" when referring to the project, and always refer to the user as "the user".


### Must and Might

Use the word MUST to explain something a user has to accomplish in your documentation.

Use the word MIGHT to explain something a user optionally can chose to accomplish in your documentation.

Never use the word MAY.
