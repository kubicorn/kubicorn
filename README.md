## About

`kubicorn` is an **unofficial** project that solves the Kubernetes infrastructure problem and gives users a rich golang library to work with infrastructure.

`kubicorn` is a project that helps a user manage cloud infrastructure for Kubernetes.
With `kubicorn` a user can create new clusters, modify and scale them, and take a snapshot of their cluster at any time.

**NOTE:** This is a work-in-progress, we do not consider it production ready.
Use at your own risk and if you're as excited about it as we are, maybe you want to join us on the `#kubicorn` channel in the [Kubernetes Slack community](http://slack.k8s.io/).

Previously, we mainly used a channel in the [Gophers Slack community](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/), which is still active, but we're moving to the Kubernetes Slack.
You can also get involved and send your questions to our [public mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubicorn-users-and-developers).

We hold developer calls on every 3rd Friday of the month. By joining the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubicorn-users-and-developers), you'll get a calendar invite.

# Core Values

#### Community first.

This is a community driven project. We love you, and respect you. We are here to help you learn, help you grow, and help you succeed. If you have an idea, please share it.

#### Developer empathy.

We are all software engineers, and we all work in many different code bases. We want the code to be stable, and approachable. We strive for clean and simple software, and we encourage refactoring and fixing technical debt.

#### Operational empathy.

We want our tool to work, and work well. If an operator is running `kubicorn` it should feel comfortable and make sense to them. We want operators to feel empowered.

#### Infrastructure as software.

We believe that the oh-so important layer of infrastructure should be represented as software (not as code!). We hope that our project demonstrates this idea, so the community can begin thinking in the way of the new paradigm.

#### Rainbows and Unicorns

We believe that sharing is important, and encouraging our peers is even more important. Part of contributing to `kubicorn` means respecting, encouraging, and welcoming others to the project.

# Installing

$ go get github.com/kris-nova/kubicorn
```

..or read the [Install Guide](http://kubicorn.io/documentation/install.html).

## Quickstart

This asciicast shows how to get a Kubernetes cluster on Digital Ocean using kubicorn in less than 5 minutes:

## How is Kubicorn different?

1) We use kubeadm to bootstrap our clusters
2) We strive for developer empathy, and clean and simple code
3) We strive for operational empathy, and clean and simple user experience
4) We start with struct literals for profiles, and then marshal into an object
5) We offer the tooling as a library, more than a command line tool
6) We are atomic, and will un-do any work if there is an error
7) We run on many operating systems
8) We allow users to define their own arbitrary bootstrap logic
9) We have no guarantee that anything works, ever, use at your own risk
10) We have no dependency on DNS
11) We believe in snapshots, and that a user should be able to capture a cluster, and move it

# Concepts

### Create

`kubicorn` lets a user create a Kubernetes cluster in a cloud of their choice.

### Apply

Define what you want, then apply it. That simple.

### Scale

`kubicorn` is powered by a state enforcement pattern.
A user defines the intended state of Kubernetes infrastructure, and `kubicorn` can enforce the intended state.

### Enforce

`kubicorn` is built as a library and a framework. Thus allowing it to be easily vendored into operator and controller patterns to enforce intended state of infrastructure.
