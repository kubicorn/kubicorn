*Navops Launch*
---

Navops Launch is currently in between releases and unavailable for download.  We will
update this location and our navops.io site once the new version is good to go.  The
navops.io site will continue to host Navops Command (https://navops.io/command.html).
Navops Command provides advanced scheduling and policy management for Kubernetes 
allowing multi-tenancy, cluster consolidation and advanced resource management.
